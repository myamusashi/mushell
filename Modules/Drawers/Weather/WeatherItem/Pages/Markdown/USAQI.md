The USA AQI is a standard system from the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) for measuring air quality on a scale of 0-500. The higher the AQI value, the worse the air quality.

0-50 (Good): Air quality is good, safe for everyone to do outdoor activities without restrictions.

51-100 (Moderate): Air quality is acceptable, but people who are very sensitive to air pollution may experience minor health effects.

101-150 (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups): Sensitive groups such as children, elderly, and people with asthma or heart disease may experience health effects. General public is still safe.

151-200 (Unhealthy): Everyone may begin to experience health effects, sensitive groups may experience more serious effects. Reduce heavy outdoor activities.

201-300 (Very Unhealthy): Serious health alert, everyone is at risk of experiencing health problems. Avoid outdoor activities.

Wind speed measures how fast the air is moving, usually expressed in km/h, m/s, or knots. A light breeze ranges from 5-20 km/h, a moderate wind is between 20-40 km/h, and a strong wind is above 40 km/h.
Wind gusts are sudden, brief increases in wind speed, usually lasting less than 20 seconds. Gusts can be 30-50% stronger than the average wind speed and are more dangerous because of their unpredictable nature. For example, if the average wind speed is 30 km/h, gusts can reach 45-50 km/h.

Strong gusts can uproot trees, damage buildings, and make driving dangerous, especially for tall vehicles such as trucks or buses. Outdoor activities such as sailing, hiking, or camping require attention to wind conditions for safety.

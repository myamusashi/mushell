Visibility measures how far you can see clearly, usually expressed in kilometers or meters. Ideal conditions provide visibility of more than 10 km, allowing you to see the landscape clearly.
Precipitation such as heavy rain can reduce visibility to 1-5 km because water droplets block light. Very heavy rain can even limit visibility to less than 1 km. Heavy snow has an even more severe effect, often reducing visibility to just a few hundred meters.
Fog is the main cause of low visibility, especially thick fog, which can reduce visibility to less than 200 meters or even 50 meters in extreme conditions. Smoke, dust, or air pollution can also reduce air quality and limit visibility. Visibility conditions are very important for driving safety, aviation, and outdoor activities.

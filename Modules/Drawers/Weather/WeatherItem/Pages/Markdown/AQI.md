Air quality measures the level of pollution in the atmosphere, including fine particles (PM2.5, PM10), ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and other pollutants. The two main standards used are the European Air Quality Index (EAQI) and the US Air Quality Index (AQI).

The EAQI uses a scale of 0-100+ with the following categories: good (0-25), moderate (25-50), unhealthy for sensitive groups (50-75), unhealthy (75-100), and very unhealthy (100+). This system focuses on PM2.5, PM10, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide. 

Meanwhile, the US AQI uses a scale of 0-500 with the following categories: good (0-50), moderate (51-100), unhealthy for sensitive groups (101-150), unhealthy (151-200), very unhealthy (201-300), hazardous (301-500).


Poor air quality can trigger respiratory problems, eye and throat irritation, and worsen asthma and heart disease. Vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and people with respiratory diseases should limit outdoor activities when air quality is moderate to poor. Air pollution often increases in the morning during rush hour and in densely populated urban areas.

Sunrise occurs when the sun appears above the horizon in the morning, marking the beginning of daylight hours. The exact time varies by location and season. During sunrise, temperatures are typically at their coolest point of the day, and visibility gradually improves as natural light increases.

Sunset is when the sun disappears below the horizon in the evening, ending the period of daylight. Like sunrise, the timing depends on geographic location and time of year. Temperatures begin to drop after sunset, and darkness gradually sets in as twilight fades.

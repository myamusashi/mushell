Lunar illumination measures how much of the moon's surface is visible from Earth, expressed as a percentage. A figure of 0% means a new moon (not visible), 50% means half the moon is visible, and 100% means a full moon is fully illuminated. The full moon provides bright natural light at night, facilitating activities such as camping or night photography. Conversely, the new moon creates a very dark sky, ideal for observing stars and galaxies as there is no moonlight to obstruct the view. The phases of the moon also affect the tides, with the highest tides occurring during the new moon and full moon.

**New Moon**: The moon is positioned between Earth and the sun, with its illuminated side facing away from us. The moon is essentially invisible in the night sky, though you might detect its dark silhouette during a solar eclipse.

**Waxing Crescent**: A thin sliver of light appears on the right side of the moon (in the Northern Hemisphere). This delicate crescent grows slightly larger each night as more of the moon's face catches sunlight. It's visible in the western sky shortly after sunset.

**First Quarter**: Exactly half of the moon's face is illuminated, resembling a perfect half-circle. Despite the name "quarter," this refers to the moon being one-quarter of the way through its cycle, not its appearance. It's visible from noon through midnight and sits high in the sky at sunset.

**Waxing Gibbous**: More than half but not quite all of the moon is illuminated, creating a bulging, egg-like shape. The term "gibbous" comes from Latin meaning "hump." The bright area continues expanding each night as the moon approaches fullness.

**Full Moon**: The entire face of the moon is brilliantly lit because Earth sits between the moon and sun, allowing sunlight to fully illuminate the side facing us. It rises at sunset, remains visible all night, and sets at sunrise, providing maximum nighttime illumination.

**Waning Gibbous**: Just past full, the moon begins to shrink. More than half remains illuminated, but the left side (in the Northern Hemisphere) now appears slightly darkened. It rises later each evening and remains visible into the morning hours.

**Last Quarter**: Once again half-illuminated, but now the opposite half from the first quarter. The left side glows while the right fades into darkness. It rises around midnight and remains visible through the morning.

**Waning Crescent**: A thin crescent on the left side is all that remains visible. This delicate arc continues to thin each night until it disappears completely. It's best seen in the eastern sky just before dawn, signaling the cycle's imminent return to new moon.

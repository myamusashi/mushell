Surface air pressure measures the weight of the atmosphere above sea level, expressed in hPa (hectopascals) or mbar (millibars). Normal pressure ranges from 1013 to 1015 hPa.
High pressure (above 1020 hPa) usually brings clear and stable weather because the air descends and prevents cloud formation. Conversely, low pressure (below 1000 hPa) is often associated with bad weather, thick clouds, and the possibility of rain because the air rises and condenses.
Rapid changes in pressure indicate significant weather changes. A drastic drop often indicates an approaching storm, while a rapid rise indicates improving weather. Barometers measure this pressure to help predict short-term weather conditions.

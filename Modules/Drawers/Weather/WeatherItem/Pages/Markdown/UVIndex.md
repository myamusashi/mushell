The UV Index measures the intensity of ultraviolet radiation from the sun that reaches the earth's surface, on a scale of 0-11+. The higher the number, the greater the risk of skin and eye damage from sun exposure.

Low levels (0-2) require minimal protection.

Moderate levels (3-5) require a hat and sunscreen when outdoors for more than 30 minutes.

High levels (6-7) require the use of SPF 30+ sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses, as well as avoiding direct sunlight at midday.

Very high levels (8-10) can cause skin damage in a short time.

Excessive UV exposure without protection can cause sunburn, premature aging, eye damage, and increase the risk of skin cancer. Even on cloudy days, up to 80% of UV radiation can still penetrate clouds. Peak UV intensity typically occurs between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.

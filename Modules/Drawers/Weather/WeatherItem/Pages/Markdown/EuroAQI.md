The European AQI is a standard system from the European Environment Agency (EEA) for measuring air quality on a scale of 0-100+. This system uses different categories from the USA AQI.


0-20 (Good): Air quality is excellent, no health risks for outdoor activities.


20-40 (Fair): Air quality is good, safe for everyone to do normal activities.


40-60 (Moderate): Air quality is moderate, people with very sensitive respiratory issues may need to reduce intense outdoor activities.


60-80 (Poor): Air quality is poor, sensitive groups such as children, elderly, and people with respiratory problems should reduce heavy outdoor activities.


80-100 (Very Poor): Air quality is very poor, everyone should reduce outdoor activities especially heavy ones. Sensitive groups should stay indoors.

100+ (Extremely Poor): Air quality is extremely hazardous, everyone must avoid outdoor activities and stay indoors with closed ventilation.

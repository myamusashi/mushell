Humidity measures the amount of water vapor in the air, typically expressed as relative humidity—the percentage of moisture the air holds compared to its maximum capacity at that temperature. High humidity makes hot weather feel more uncomfortable because sweat evaporates slowly from our skin, while low humidity causes rapid evaporation, leading to dry skin and making cold air feel harsher.

Dew point is the temperature at which air becomes saturated and water vapor condenses into dew or fog. Unlike relative humidity which fluctuates with temperature, dew point provides a stable measure of actual moisture content. Dew points above 65°F (18°C) feel uncomfortable, and above 70°F (21°C) feel oppressive, making it a more reliable indicator of how muggy the air actually feels.

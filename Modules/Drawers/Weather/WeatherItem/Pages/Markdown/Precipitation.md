Precipitation is any form of water that falls from the atmosphere to the Earth's surface, including rain, snow, hail, or drizzle. Some important aspects of precipitation include probability, duration, intensity, and accumulation.

The probability of precipitation is expressed as a percentage, indicating the likelihood of rain occurring in a given area. A figure of 30% means that there is a 3 in 10 chance of rain falling in your location. Duration measures how long the precipitation lasts, ranging from a few minutes for a drizzle to several hours for prolonged rain.

Intensity classifies how hard the precipitation falls. Light rain ranges from 0-2.5 mm/hour, moderate rain from 2.5-10 mm/hour, heavy rain from 10-50 mm/hour, and very heavy rain above 50 mm/hour. Accumulation indicates the total rainfall collected over a specific period of time, usually measured in millimeters. An accumulation of 10-20 mm is enough to make the ground wet, while over 50 mm in a day can cause flooding in areas with poor drainage.
